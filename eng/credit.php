        An initiation project for HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL.. The conceiving of our projects was assisted by 
         Mister <span class="mr">RAVELONATOANDRO Sedra</span> ,teacher at Institut d'enseignement supérieur d'Antsirabe Vakinakaratra 
        (IES-AV).. Being on level License1 mention génie Logiciel,, Mister Sedra told us to create a project including 
        <mark>CRUID</mark> or CREATE READ UPDATE INSERT DELETE. <br>
        So I(the developper) decided to create a WEB-application which take hand a presidential election which includes
        three presidents.. this application haves the following points: *Autentification of the administrator 
        *Inscription to the election list *List of joined to election *The election 
        *List of people who voted *List of people who didn't voted yet *Result of the election. <br><br>
